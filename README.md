# Resume 💼🏢💻📄🗂📎🗄️🏦📠🖇🖨📱📧

You will utilize GitHub Pages to create a host your resume.

## Part 1 - Wireframes

1. Create wireframes for what you want your website to look like. You can use paper or a wireframe tool like [https://balsamiq.com/](https://balsamiq.com/) or (https://www.figma.com/)[https://www.figma.com/]
2. Upload your final wireframes to this repository.
3. Have Generative AI create a starter set of code from your wireframes.
4. Commit that starter version here so that it appears in your version history.
5. Update and fix your website so that it will look the way you want it to.

This website will include:

* At least four pages that you can navigate to, consider index, about me, projects, socials, bio, demo real, portfolio, etc.
* Have at least two interactive JavaScript components that alter the view but are also accessible with a keyboard. Consider a button to switch between light and dark mode themes, a switch to change languages from English to Spanish, something to change the font sizes, go to high contrast mode, etc.
* Include a professionally written, styled, and presented resume. Visit with the career services people to have them look it over.
* Create your own favicon.
* Publish your website onto GitHub Pages.

Be sure that you have:

* Validated your HTML using [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure no errors nor warnings.
* Verify that you are well documenting your code using [JSDoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc) standards. You do not need to generate an API.
* Include View Testing with puppeteer to ensure your website is updating as expected.
* Test your color contrast by visiting [a11y.com](https://color.a11y.com/).

**Optional**:

Purchase a domain name for your site and link it to your GitHub pages. I've used Google Domains, recently purchased by SquareSpace, with usually costs $1 for a domain name such as [www.oscarveliz.com](http://www.oscarveliz.com) and it is always a good idea to at least grab your name before someone else does. See [https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) for more information on how to do this.

## Part 2 - Reflection

Add screenshots below showing,

* Your app running on GitHub Pages
* Your html validation
* Your view testing

Update the README to answer the following questions:

 1. What was your experience like using generative AI with your wireframes?
 2. What specific feedback did the career services people give you about your resume?
 3. What aspects of this project did you find particularly challenging and why? Explain how you overcame them.
 4. Explain how you created a custom favicon for your page.
 5. Write a short reflection about what you've learned in this class so far. Think about all the technologies we've used, the activities you've done, the programs you've made, and how far you've come. Please give me your honest thoughts as I'll use this to update the course going forward.
