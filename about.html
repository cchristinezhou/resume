        <p>From a young age, I was naturally drawn to math and problem solving — the thrill of cracking a tough problem
          always excited me.</p>
        <p>When I started college at Vanderbilt University, my path seemed certain: pre-med. Yet, life has a funny way
          of redirecting us. To fulfill a basic liberal arts requirement, I enrolled in CS 1101, an introductory
          programming course in Java.</p>
        <p>What I expected to be a simple box-checking exercise turned into something much more. Programming came
          incredibly naturally to me — a surprising discovery, especially since growing up, I never imagined myself in
          tech. In my mind, software engineering was reserved for “geeks,” and I wasn’t sure I fit that mold. But as the
          semester unfolded, I realized this wasn’t about stereotypes or labels — it was about problem-solving,
          creativity, and building something from scratch, all things I loved.</p>

      <div class="about-text">
        <p>Alongside my coursework, I worked in several research labs focused on the intersection of medicine and
          technology. One of the projects that shaped my interests most was a virtual reality-based community designed
          to help individuals manage substance addiction. Our goal was to create immersive environments to curb cravings
          and promote recovery.</p>
        <p>I initially joined the lab through my pre-med track, but the work I did was heavily technical — I used MATLAB
          to scrape data from Reddit, building a machine learning model that could predict withdrawal struggles based on
          user posts. It was my first real taste of applying computational methods to solve real-world problems, and it
          lit a spark. It showed me that technology wasn’t just a tool — it was a bridge between disciplines, a way to
          innovate in fields I deeply cared about.</p>
        <p>Encouraged by that experience, I pivoted my academic focus, eventually double majoring in Computer Science
          and Applied Mathematics while completing a minor in Neuroscience. Even as I transitioned away from pre-med, my
          passion for understanding the brain never faded — a passion that continues to fuel my curiosity today.</p>

      <h2 class="visually-hidden">Engineering and AI Journey</h2>
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>In fact, it was my background in neuroscience that initially sparked my fascination with artificial
          intelligence. Neural networks, the cornerstone of modern AI, felt like a natural extension of my academic
          interests. To this day, I still enjoy diving into neuroscience podcasts and staying curious about how
          biological intelligence informs machine learning.</p>
        <p>After graduating, I spent several years as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, specializing in iOS development
          for Microsoft Teams. During my time there, I honed my technical skills, worked on large-scale mobile
          applications, and collaborated with brilliant teams across the company. It was a formative experience that
          allowed me to grow not only as an engineer but also as a problem-solver and teammate.</p>
        <p>However, my experience in the industry also made me realize how much more there was to learn — especially in
          the fields of machine learning and AI, which had always been close to my heart. I found myself craving a
          deeper, more structured understanding of these disciplines beyond what I had explored in undergrad.</p>
        <p>That desire led me to pursue a graduate degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University, specializing
          in Machine Learning and AI. It’s a decision fueled by curiosity, passion, and a drive to keep pushing the
          boundaries of what I can create.</p>
        <p>Outside of engineering, I still believe deeply in creativity and storytelling — passions that fuel my love
          for photography, YouTube content creation, and design. Whether I’m building intelligent systems or capturing
          moments behind a camera lens, my goal is the same: to create meaningful, empowering experiences for others.
